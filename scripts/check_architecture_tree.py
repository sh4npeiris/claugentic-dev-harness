"""Enforce that docs/ARCHITECTURE_TREE.md indexes every in-scope source file.

Deterministic gate (no LLM): checks PRESENCE (every in-scope file appears in the
tree), STALENESS (no tree entry points to a file that no longer exists), and GLOB
DRIFT (INCLUDE_GLOBS watches NO files while the repo nonetheless contains source —
the zero-coverage rot a wrong/unset glob would otherwise hide). Descriptions are
authored by humans/agents — this script does not write them. Drift DETECTION is
mechanical (the gate flags); resetting the globs is the agent's job, not the gate's.

In-scope = tracked + staged + **untracked-not-ignored** files matching the globs,
so a file just created via Write (not yet `git add`-ed) is caught immediately.

Fails loud: `_git` raises `RuntimeError` if git is missing or returns non-zero
(missing/erroring git or a non-repo cwd must NEVER read as a green "0 in-scope
files"). A returncode-0 with empty stdout is legitimate (empty repo / glob matches
nothing) and is left as an empty list. `main()` is the boundary that maps a git
failure to each mode's exit code (see below).

Modes:
    python scripts/check_architecture_tree.py                # human/CI: stdout, exit 1 on problems
    python scripts/check_architecture_tree.py --hook          # Stop hook: full scan, silent OK, stderr+exit 2 on problems
    python scripts/check_architecture_tree.py --hook-write     # PostToolUse(Write) hook: reads the written path from
                                                              # stdin; nudges ONLY if it's a new, in-scope, undocumented
                                                              # file (silent on overwrites / out-of-scope / already-indexed)

Wired as a hook by `init` when the architecture-tree gate is enabled; otherwise run
manually (`python scripts/check_architecture_tree.py`). Also runnable in CI. See
CLAUDE.md -> Harness Discipline.

# INCLUDE_GLOBS is the ONLY per-repo knob. It lists the files that MUST be indexed
# in ARCHITECTURE_TREE.md. The `init` skill detects the target repo's
# languages/layout and writes the right globs here. They are passed to git as
# pathspecs; the `:(glob)` prefix gives true globstar (** spans directories, incl.
# zero).
#
# Entries MUST use EXTENSION globs (end in `*.<ext>`, e.g. `:(glob)src/**/*.ts`,
# `:(glob)cmd/**/*.go`) so the valid extensions are derivable (EXTS below) — that
# single source of truth drives the staleness check, with no second per-repo regex
# to keep in sync. An entry with no derivable `*.<ext>` (e.g. a bare directory glob
# like `:(glob)src/**`) is still PRESENCE-checked but is NOT staleness-checked
# (its files can't be told apart from any other path token in the tree's prose).
#
# This file is COPIED into adopter repos, so INCLUDE_GLOBS is per-repo: `init` rewrites it

# below is the SOURCE repo's own (claugentic-dev-harness): the gate scripts plus the
# executable Workflow choreography under `engine/` (read-from-install-path, never copied
# to adopters — so this `engine/` widening is source-repo-only; init's body-compare already
# excludes the INCLUDE_GLOBS line on both sides, so no adopter REFRESH triggers). EXTS derives
# `js` automatically — every new in-scope file must be tree-indexed or CI goes red, the point.
