"""Enforce that docs/claugentic-ARCHITECTURE_TREE.md indexes every in-scope source file.

Deterministic gate (no LLM): checks PRESENCE (every in-scope file appears in the
tree), STALENESS (no tree entry points to a file that no longer exists), and GLOB
DRIFT (INCLUDE_GLOBS watches NO files while the repo nonetheless contains source —
the zero-coverage rot a wrong/unset glob would otherwise hide). Descriptions are
authored by humans/agents — this script does not write them. Drift DETECTION is
mechanical (the gate flags); resetting the globs is the agent's job, not the gate's.

In-scope = tracked + staged + **untracked-not-ignored** files matching the globs,
so a file just created via Write (not yet `git add`-ed) is caught immediately.

Fails loud: `_git` raises `RuntimeError` if git is missing or returns non-zero
(missing/erroring git or a non-repo cwd must NEVER read as a green "0 in-scope
files"). A returncode-0 with empty stdout is legitimate (empty repo / glob matches
nothing) and is left as an empty list. `main()` is the boundary that maps a git
failure to exit 1 (the only non-zero exit).

Modes:
    python scripts/claugentic-check_architecture_tree.py            # manual/CI: full scan, stdout, exit 1 on problems
    python scripts/claugentic-check_architecture_tree.py --staged    # pre-commit scope: gate the INDEX (tracked + staged),
                                                          # never unrelated untracked working-tree files

Run once per `git commit` by the `.githooks/pre-commit` wrapper (wired via
`core.hooksPath=.githooks`, which `init` configures for an adopter when the
architecture-tree gate is enabled); otherwise run manually / in CI. `init` decides
per scenario: FRESH (no tree, no source) and MATURE-NO-TREE (no tree, source present →
a cheap-complete backtick-prose skeleton) get the gate ON (pre-commit hook wired);
MATURE-WITH-TREE (an existing tree) is asked — Replace with a harness skeleton (gate ON)
or Keep-mine (gate OFF, INCLUDE_GLOBS=[], no hook wired). See CLAUDE.md ->
Harness Discipline.

    em-dash (`—`, as in the "is missing —" message) mojibakes to `�` (a strict cp1252 console
    can even raise UnicodeEncodeError). Reconfiguring to UTF-8 fixes every message at once. A
    captured/replaced stream (pytest, a pipe wrapper) may lack `.reconfigure` → guarded,
    best-effort.
