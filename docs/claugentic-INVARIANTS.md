# Load-bearing invariants

Constraints that **must stay true or something breaks** — recorded so the next change in
their blast radius reads *why* before touching them. This is **live documentation, not a
gate**: nothing mechanically enforces these. One entry per genuine invariant; most code
has none, so keep this lean. (Sibling to `docs/claugentic-DECISIONS.md` — a *decision* is
"what we chose"; an *invariant* is "what must hold".)

Each entry: **the invariant** · **why** (what breaks if violated) · **provenance** (dated —
the failure or near-miss that taught it).

## The two version manifests must move together

- **Invariant —** `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` carry the same version; every bump
  moves both, with `plugin.json` as the source of truth.
- **Why —** they are one logical stamp; a drifted pair ships an install whose advertised
  version lies about its contents, and the marketplace serves the wrong tree.
- **Provenance —** 2026-06-22: codified after the version-sync gate (`check_versions_synced.py`)
  was added to mechanically catch a drift that had previously been caught only by eye.
