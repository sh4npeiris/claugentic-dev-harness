# Docs & Traceability — the change is explainable, the architecture is navigable

> **Loads when:** changes add, move, or remove files (ARCHITECTURE_TREE.md); introduce non-trivial decisions (DECISIONS.md); modify public APIs or non-obvious logic (docstrings/comments); or touch onboarding/runbook documentation.
> **ISO/IEC 25010:** maintainability · **Status:** draft · **v0.1.0**

Each entry below is one **auditable dimension**. Per change, the reviewer applies the
*relevant* ones **fully** (select-don't-skip), right-sized to the change — never
gold-plating an irrelevant one, never skipping a relevant one.

## Architecture-tree index currency

- **Good looks like —** `docs/claugentic-ARCHITECTURE_TREE.md` reflects the actual file layout with a one-line description per file. Every file add, move, or delete within scope triggers an update to the tree in the same commit.
- **Auditor checks —** If the architecture-tree gate is wired, run it (`python` / `python3` / `py` — `scripts/claugentic-check_architecture_tree.py`) and confirm exit 0 `[D]`; otherwise verify the tree by eye `[J]`. Either way, confirm any new file added in this change has a description entry `[J]`.
- **Confidence —** `mixed`
- **Tradeoff (plain English) —** A current ARCHITECTURE_TREE means a new agent (or team member) can navigate the codebase without reading every file; the cost is updating one line per file change. A stale tree wastes agent context and misdirects exploration.
- **Sources —** the claugentic-dev-harness architecture-tree discipline (a first-class harness rule); Grady Booch "Object-Oriented Analysis and Design" on the value of navigable architecture documentation.

## Decision traceability (DECISIONS.md)

- **Good looks like —** Every non-trivial choice (library selection, pattern choice, schema decision, API contract) is recorded as a dated one-liner in `docs/claugentic-DECISIONS.md` in the same commit that introduces the decision. Future agents consult it before re-litigating a past choice.
- **Auditor checks —** Review the diff for non-trivial decisions not yet recorded `[J]`; confirm `claugentic-DECISIONS.md` entry is dated and includes the rationale, not just the choice `[J]`.
- **Confidence —** `judgment` — what counts as "non-trivial" is a reviewer call.
- **Tradeoff (plain English) —** A decisions log prevents the same debate from happening three times with three different outcomes; it costs 30 seconds per decision. Without it, future agents re-open closed decisions and introduce inconsistency.
- **Sources —** Michael Nygard "Documenting Architecture Decisions" (https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) — the original ADR essay; CLAUDE.md harness discipline.

## Docstrings and inline comments

- **Good looks like —** Public APIs, non-obvious algorithms, and "why not the obvious approach" reasoning carry docstrings or inline comments. Comments explain *why*, not *what* (the code says what). Trivial getters and self-evident code are not commented (noise reduction).
- **Auditor checks —** Confirm public functions/classes have docstrings `[D]` (enforced by lint where available); flag complex or counterintuitive logic that has no explanatory comment `[J]`; flag comments that merely restate the code `[J]`.
- **Confidence —** `mixed`
- **Tradeoff (plain English) —** Good docstrings let the next developer understand intent without running a debugger; the cost is a few extra lines. "Clean code reads like prose" is aspirational — reality has edge cases worth narrating. Over-commenting creates noise that ages badly.
- **Sources —** Robert C. Martin "Clean Code" ch. 4 "Comments"; Google Python Style Guide §3.8 "Comments and Docstrings" (https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings).

---

## Onboarding and runbook documentation

- **Good looks like —** A new developer can clone and run the project by following `docs/SETUP.md` without asking anyone. Operational procedures (deploy, rollback, incident response, cron management) have a runbook reference. The README explains the project's purpose and entry points.
- **Auditor checks —** If setup steps changed, confirm `docs/SETUP.md` is updated in this commit `[J]`; verify any new operational procedure (cron, migration, flag toggle) has a runbook reference `[J]`.
- **Confidence —** `judgment` — completeness of onboarding docs is a reviewer call.
- **Tradeoff (plain English) —** Current setup docs cut onboarding from days to hours and enable incident response without the original author present; the cost is updating docs alongside the code change. Stale setup docs are worse than none — they actively mislead.
- **Sources —** Thoughtworks "Documentation" in "Building Microservices" (Sam Newman); Google SRE Book ch. 32 "The Evolving SRE Engagement Model" on runbook quality.

## Change explainability (commit and PR narrative)

- **Good looks like —** Commits follow Conventional Commits style (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.) and the message explains *why*, not just *what*. PRs include a summary, test plan, and link to the relevant spec/issue. The change can be understood from its git history without reading the code.
- **Auditor checks —** Confirm commit messages are conventional and explain motivation `[J]`; verify PR description covers what changed, why, and how to test it `[J]`.
- **Confidence —** `judgment` — message quality is a reviewer call.
- **Tradeoff (plain English) —** Good commit messages make `git blame` a first-class debugging tool and turn code review into a narrative rather than a puzzle; the cost is two extra sentences per commit. A repo with poor commit history forces every future change to reverse-engineer intent from code alone.
- **Sources —** Conventional Commits specification v1.0.0 (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/); Chris Beams "How to Write a Git Commit Message" (https://cbea.ms/git-commit/).

## Authoring rules (the catalog meta-rules — do not delete)

- **Additive floor:** add dimensions as you discover them; **never delete** one. This catalog is meant to become "every standard we can think of."
- **Right-size:** apply only *relevant* dimensions per change (`KISS`/`YAGNI`); never skip a relevant one. Relevance is a per-change judgment — see `README.md`.
- **Novel patterns allowed** when they add clear value — justify (problem → why existing patterns fall short → benefit) and record in `claugentic-DECISIONS.md`. Unconventional ≠ wrong.
- **Every dimension carries a Confidence tag** so the harness can separate what it *proved* (deterministic gates) from what it *asserts* (judgment). Trust the oracle, not the model's word.
