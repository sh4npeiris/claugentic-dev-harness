# Maintainability & Structure — is this code shaped so the next change is cheap?

> **Loads when:** new/changed code introduces or reshapes structure — modules, layers, services, interfaces, abstractions; refactors; anything where SOLID, layering, design-pattern choice, coupling/cohesion, type-safety, naming, or code-health is in play.
> **ISO/IEC 25010:** Maintainability (modularity, reusability, analysability, modifiability, testability) · **Status:** draft · **v0.1.0**

Each entry below is one **auditable dimension**. Per change, the reviewer applies the
*relevant* ones **fully** (select-don't-skip), right-sized to the change — never
gold-plating an irrelevant one, never skipping a relevant one. Tags: `[D]` a gate/tool
can prove it · `[J]` needs a reviewer's eye.

## SOLID

- **Good looks like —** Each unit has **one reason to change** (SRP); behavior extends without editing stable code (OCP — see *Open/Closed & config-driven* dimension); subtypes honor their base's contract — no surprises, no strengthened preconditions / weakened postconditions (LSP); clients depend on **narrow role interfaces**, not fat ones (ISP); high-level policy depends on **abstractions**, not concretions (DIP — see *Dependency direction* dimension).
- **Auditor checks —** `[J]` Does any class/function mix unrelated responsibilities (e.g. HTTP parsing + business rules + SQL in one place)? (SRP) `[J]` Does adding a case require editing a `switch`/`if-else` over a closed set instead of adding a type (OCP smell — full treatment in *Open/Closed & config-driven* dimension)? `[J]` Does a subtype throw `NotImplemented`, no-op an inherited method, or narrow accepted inputs (LSP break)? `[D]` Interface width — flag interfaces whose implementers stub out methods they don't use (ISP). *(DIP import-direction is audited in the *Dependency direction* dimension — see there.)*
- **Confidence —** `mixed` — SRP/OCP/LSP are `[J]` reviewer calls; ISP is partly `[D]` where an interface-width / unused-member linter flags stubbed methods. *(DIP, the other deterministic-capable check, lives in the *Dependency direction* dimension.)*
- **Tradeoff (plain English) —** Code that follows these five rules costs a little more up front to shape, but each later change touches one small place instead of rippling everywhere. Skip them and the system calcifies — every "small" change becomes risky and slow.
- **Sources —** R.C. Martin, *Agile Software Development / Clean Architecture* (SOLID); B. Liskov, "Data Abstraction and Hierarchy" (LSP); B. Meyer, design-by-contract (pre/post-conditions).

## Separation of concerns

- **Good looks like —** Distinct concerns live in distinct units: HTTP/transport, orchestration, business rules, persistence, and presentation don't bleed into each other. A change to one concern (swap the DB, change the wire format) doesn't force edits across the others.
- **Auditor checks —** `[J]` Is there business logic inside a controller/handler, an ORM call inside a domain entity, or formatting inside a repository? `[J]` Can you name the single concern each module owns in one phrase? `[D]` Layer-boundary lint (import-linter / dependency-cruiser / `madge`) flags cross-concern imports where rules exist.
- **Confidence —** `mixed`
- **Tradeoff (plain English) —** Keeping concerns apart means a UI change can't break a billing rule and a database swap can't break the UI. The cost is more files and a little indirection; the payoff is changes that stay contained.
- **Sources —** Dijkstra, "On the role of scientific thought" (origin of *separation of concerns*); R.C. Martin, *Clean Architecture*.

## Architectural layers (Clean / Hexagonal / Onion)

- **Good looks like —** Code organizes into rings with **dependencies pointing inward only** (The Dependency Rule): **Domain/Entities** (pure business types & invariants, zero framework imports) ← **Application/Use-cases** (orchestration, transaction script / service layer) ← **Ports** (interfaces the inner rings own) ← **Adapters** (presentation/**API**/controllers, **repository** impls, gateways, message consumers — the replaceable edge). At the outer edge sits a discrete **validation layer — schema/contract enforcement at the edge, never inside domain objects**: untrusted input is validated/parsed into a typed shape before it crosses inward. **DTOs** carry data across the boundary; mapping happens at the edge; an **anti-corruption layer** translates a foreign model so it can't leak inward. The domain never imports the web framework, the ORM, or an external SDK.
- **Auditor checks —** `[D]` Does any inner-ring file import an outer-ring concern (framework, ORM, HTTP, SDK)? — provable with an import-boundary linter (import-linter contracts / dependency-cruiser / ArchUnit-style). `[J]` Are ports defined by the **inner** ring and implemented by the **outer** ring (dependency inversion at the boundary), not the reverse? `[J]` Do DTOs exist at the boundary so the domain model isn't serialized straight to the wire? `[J]` Is validation logic confined to the boundary and absent from domain entities / use-case code? `[J]` Is there an ACL/translator where an external/legacy model enters?
- **Confidence —** `mixed`
- **Tradeoff (plain English) —** Layering lets you replace the database, the web framework, or a third-party vendor without rewriting your business rules — and lets you test those rules without spinning up any of them. The cost is more boundaries and mapping code; for a tiny script it's overkill (apply right-sized).
- **Sources —** R.C. Martin, *Clean Architecture* (The Dependency Rule, 2012); A. Cockburn, *Hexagonal / Ports & Adapters* (2005); J. Palermo, *Onion Architecture* (2008); E. Evans, *DDD* (anti-corruption layer, layered architecture); Fowler, *PoEAA* (Service Layer, DTO).

## Design-pattern catalog (use the right one — or justify a novel one)

- **Good looks like —** When a recurring problem appears, a **named, established pattern** is applied deliberately (not cargo-culted): **persistence/data** — Repository, Unit-of-Work, Specification, Data Mapper, Gateway; **behavioral** — Strategy, Observer, Mediator, Template Method, Command; **creational** — Factory / Abstract Factory, Builder, Dependency Injection; **structural** — Decorator, Adapter, Facade, Proxy, Composite; **resilience/distributed** — Circuit-Breaker, Bulkhead, Saga (orchestration/choreography), Transactional Outbox, Retry, Timeout. A pattern is used where it earns its keep, named in code/comments/commit, and not layered on where a plain function would do (over-engineering is itself a smell). A **novel** pattern is allowed only with a written justification (problem → why existing patterns fall short → benefit) recorded in `claugentic-DECISIONS.md`.
- **Auditor checks —** `[J]` Does the chosen pattern actually fit the problem, or is it pattern-for-pattern's-sake (e.g. a Factory that only ever makes one type, a Strategy with one strategy)? `[J]` Is data access behind a **Repository** (collection-like interface) rather than ORM/SQL scattered through services? `[J]` Where multiple writes must commit together, is **Unit-of-Work / transaction** boundary explicit? `[J]` For cross-service writes, is **Saga + Outbox** used instead of an unsafe dual-write? `[J]` For unreliable I/O, are **Circuit-Breaker / Bulkhead / Timeout / Retry** present where apt (cross-ref `reliability-resilience`)? `[J]` If a pattern is novel/unconventional, is the justification recorded?
- **Confidence —** `judgment`
- **Tradeoff (plain English) —** Reaching for a well-known pattern means the next engineer recognizes the shape instantly and the solution is battle-tested. The cost is indirection — and forcing a pattern where none is needed makes simple code harder to read, so match the pattern to the problem.
- **Sources —** GoF, *Design Patterns* (Strategy, Observer, Factory, Decorator, Adapter, Facade, Mediator, Composite, Proxy, Template Method, Command); Fowler, *PoEAA* (Repository, Unit of Work, Data Mapper, Gateway, Service Layer); E. Evans, *DDD* (Repository, Specification, Factory); M. Nygard, *Release It!* (Circuit-Breaker, Bulkhead, Timeout); C. Richardson, *microservices.io* (Saga, Transactional Outbox).

## Composition over inheritance

- **Good looks like —** Reuse and variation come from **composing** small collaborators (has-a, delegation, injected strategies) rather than deep `extends` chains. Inheritance is reserved for genuine **is-a substitutability** (passes LSP); no inheritance used purely for code reuse.
- **Auditor checks —** `[J]` Is there an inheritance hierarchy deeper than ~2 levels, or one used only to share helper code? `[J]` Could a `extends` relationship be a constructor-injected collaborator instead? `[J]` Any "parallel inheritance hierarchies" smell (adding a subclass here forces a subclass there)?
- **Confidence —** `judgment`
- **Tradeoff (plain English) —** Building behavior by plugging pieces together keeps each piece swappable and testable; deep inheritance trees are rigid and a change near the root can break every descendant unexpectedly. Composition costs a little more wiring for far more flexibility.
- **Sources —** GoF, *Design Patterns* ("favor object composition over class inheritance"); Fowler, *Refactoring* (Replace Inheritance with Delegation).

## Dependency direction (DIP) & make invalid states unrepresentable

- **Good looks like —** Dependencies flow toward **stable abstractions**; volatile details (DB, network, vendor SDK) sit behind interfaces the stable core owns. The **type system makes illegal states impossible** — sum/union types and enums over stringly-typed flags, non-nullable by default, value objects/branded types that validate on construction so an invalid instance can't exist, exhaustive matches the compiler enforces.
- **Auditor checks —** `[D]` Import direction — where an import-boundary linter is configured (import-linter / dependency-cruiser / ESLint `no-restricted-imports`), does it flag violations of "imports point toward abstractions"? `[J]` Without tooling, manually trace the import graph for DIP violations — do high-level modules reach for concrete low-level details instead of an abstraction? `[J]` Are impossible combinations representable (e.g. `status: string` + nullable fields that "shouldn't" coexist) where a discriminated union would forbid them? `[D]` Exhaustiveness — `switch` over a union has a `never`/exhaustive default that fails the type-checker on a missing case. `[J]` Do constructors/parsers validate at the boundary so downstream code can trust the type (parse, don't validate)?
- **Confidence —** `mixed`
- **Tradeoff (plain English) —** When the types themselves rule out bad data, whole classes of bugs simply can't be written, and the compiler catches mistakes before they ship. The cost is more deliberate up-front modeling; the payoff is fewer runtime surprises and fearless refactors.
- **Sources —** R.C. Martin, DIP & SDP/SAP (*Clean Architecture*); Y. Minsky, "Effective ML" (Jane Street / Harvard CS51, 2010 — coined *make illegal states unrepresentable*); A. King, "Parse, don't validate" (2019 — the distinct parse-over-validate discipline); S. Wlaschin, *Domain Modeling Made Functional* (type-driven design; both ideas applied in F#/DDD).

## Code health & housekeeping (smells, complexity, duplication, naming, comments)

- **Good looks like —** **No dead code** (unreachable branches, unused exports/params/vars, commented-out blocks, feature-flag corpses). The **Fowler smells** are absent or paid down: *Bloaters* (Long Method, Large Class, Long Parameter List, Data Clumps, Primitive Obsession), *OO-Abusers* (Switch Statements over types, Refused Bequest), *Change-Preventers* (Divergent Change, Shotgun Surgery, Parallel Inheritance), *Dispensables* (Duplicate Code, Dead Code, Speculative Generality, Comments-as-deodorant), *Couplers* (Feature Envy, Inappropriate Intimacy, Message Chains, Middle Man). **Cyclomatic complexity** per function stays within the project threshold; **duplication** is below threshold (DRY). **Names** reveal intent (searchable, pronounceable, domain-aligned, no misleading or `tmp2` names). **Comments explain *why*, not *what*** — code is the source of truth; no stale or redundant comments.
- **Auditor checks —** `[D]` Dead/unused code — linter (`ts-prune`/`knip`, ESLint `no-unused-vars`, `vulture`, compiler unused flags) reports zero new. `[D]` Cyclomatic/cognitive complexity over threshold — ESLint `complexity` / SonarQube / `radon` / `lizard`. `[D]` Duplication over threshold — `jscpd` / SonarQube copy-paste detector. `[D]` Commented-out code blocks present? (lint/grep). `[J]` Do names read as intent at the call site; any abbreviations or misleading names? `[J]` Are comments load-bearing *why*-comments, or do they restate the code / lie about it?
- **Confidence —** `mixed`
- **Tradeoff (plain English) —** Code kept clean — nothing unused, nothing duplicated, nothing needlessly tangled, names that say what they mean — is fast and safe to change. Letting smells accumulate is borrowing against the future: each one makes the next change a little slower and a little riskier until the area becomes "scary to touch."
- **Sources —** M. Fowler, *Refactoring* (the smell catalog & its five categories); McCabe, "A Complexity Measure" (cyclomatic complexity); R.C. Martin, *Clean Code* (naming, functions, comments); B. Kernighan & P. Plauger, *Elements of Programming Style*.

## DRY by collapse — the shared source must be a FIXED POINT on the live path

- **Good looks like —** Before N duplicated implementations are replaced by one shared helper, the helper's **algebraic properties on the live path** are stated and pinned — not just its behavior at one call. The property that bites first is **idempotence**: if any live path can apply the helper **more than once** (normalized at a boundary, then again inside a consumer; normalized on write and again on read), then `f(f(x)) === f(x)` is part of its contract and carries its own assertion over a corpus that includes the degenerate inputs (empty, all-separator, already-normalized, falsy-but-present). The equivalence check for the collapse is run over the **composed value the caller observes** — the joined path, the rendered string, the persisted key — never over the helper's return at each site in isolation. Where the observable is built from several normalized segments, **every** segment is normalized at the **same** boundary, not only the one the diff happened to touch.
- **Auditor checks —** `[D]` Count the applications of the collapse target along each live path: more than one anywhere, and there must be an `f(f(x)) === f(x)` assertion over a corpus including the degenerate inputs. `[D]` Diff the **composed observable** before and after the collapse across a *generated* input corpus (not a hand-picked shape list) and report the divergence count — a collapse that changes any composed output is a behavior change needing its own approval. `[J]` Does the helper **default** before it **normalizes** (or otherwise emit a value its own second application would rewrite)? `[J]` For an observable assembled from several segments, is each one normalized, or only the one under the diff? `[D]` Does the collapse target have at least one call site at all — and does a comment claiming it is "the ONE source" name derivers that really call it? `[J]` **A total claim in a comment is earned by a pin, not by an argument:** for every "cannot diverge / always / never / the ONE source" a diff authors or re-asserts, name the assertion that turns red when it stops holding; if there is none, the honest comment states what was measured. Re-asserting a totality the same comment records as *previously false* is the loudest form of this.
- **Confidence —** `mixed` — the fixed-point assertion and the composed-output corpus diff are measurements; whether a property is load-bearing is a reviewer call.
- **Tradeoff (plain English) —** Merging duplicate copies is the standard cure for drift and usually the right call — but the merged version now runs in places the copies never did, so a property nobody checked ("what if this runs twice?") goes live everywhere at once. One extra test costs minutes; getting it wrong means the program reports a different answer than the one it acted on, and every gate stays green because the code matches its spec.
- **Incident that motivated this (delete this rule once its cause is gone) —** Plan 0041 Slice 10a (2026-08-17). The spec asked for *"one source of the artifact-directory shape"* and the diff delivered exactly that — five inconsistent copies routed through one helper. Nobody asked whether that helper was **idempotent**, and the live runtime-QA path applies it **twice** (once at the boundary, once inside the driver's prompt). It defaulted before it trimmed, so an all-separator directory trimmed to `""` and the second application substituted the default: the QA driver **saved** screenshots under one directory while the run report **cited** another. Measured, the pre-change code diverged on **0** of 23 directory shapes and the collapsed code on **8 — every one created by the collapse**; over 200,000 random pairs the divergence rate was **95.4%**. The diff conformed to the spec at every line, so reviewing it against the spec was no defense; only executing the *composed* path over a generated corpus found it. The same round found the twin defect one axis over — the diff normalized the segment left of the separator and left the label on the right raw, so the harness's own build-driven QA labels diverged too. And the comment above the helper asserted the two paths "cannot diverge" in the same paragraph that recorded the identical claim as previously false, while a backlog line filed in the same slice named one of its four listed derivers as having zero call sites. Closed by trimming before defaulting, normalizing both segments at one boundary, and pinning `f(f(x)) === f(x)`.
- **Sources —** cross-ref *Code health & housekeeping* above (this is that dimension's DRY cure, done safely) and `docs/claugentic-standards/testing.md` → *Characterization tests & golden master* (the composed-observable corpus **is** the equivalence oracle a collapse needs); idempotence as a function property — cross-ref `docs/claugentic-standards/reliability-resilience.md` → *Idempotency & safe retry*, which covers the **effectful** cousin (a retried write) and is a different concern from a pure normalizer's fixed point.

## Type safety

- **Good looks like —** Static typing is **on and strict** (e.g. TS `strict`, `noImplicitAny`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`; mypy `--strict`); `any`/`unknown`-without-narrowing, unchecked casts, and `@ts-ignore`/`# type: ignore` are absent or each carry a justified, narrowly-scoped comment. Public function signatures and module boundaries are fully typed; external/`unknown` input is validated into a typed shape at the boundary (schema → type), not cast.
- **Auditor checks —** `[D]` Type-checker passes with strict config (`tsc --noEmit`, `mypy --strict`) — no new errors and no new suppressions. `[D]` Count of `any`/`@ts-ignore`/`type: ignore` introduced (lint rule `no-explicit-any`, `no-ts-ignore`). `[J]` Is untrusted input *parsed* into a type at the edge (e.g. zod/pydantic) rather than asserted with `as`?
- **Confidence —** `mixed`
- **Tradeoff (plain English) —** Strong, strict types let the compiler catch a huge share of mistakes for free and make the code self-documenting; escaping the type system with `any`/casts silently re-opens the door to those bugs. Strictness costs some friction up front and pays it back at every change.
- **Sources —** TypeScript Handbook, "TypeScript Strict Mode" (https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strict); mypy, "–strict flag" (https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/command_line.html#cmdoption-mypy-strict); S. Wlaschin, *Domain Modeling Made Functional* (Pragmatic Programmers, 2018) — type-driven design; A. King, "Parse, don't validate" (2019, https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/).

## Open/Closed & config-driven

- **Good looks like —** Behavior that varies (by tenant, environment, locale, feature) is driven by **configuration/registration/strategy** so new variants are *added* without editing stable code. New cases register via a map/plugin/strategy table rather than growing a hard-coded `switch`. Magic numbers/strings are named constants from a single source.
- **Auditor checks —** `[J]` Does adding a variant require editing a central conditional, or registering a new entry? `[J]` Are environment/behavioral knobs configurable (not hardcoded per-env)? `[D]` Magic-literal lint where configured (`no-magic-numbers`).
- **Confidence —** `mixed`
- **Tradeoff (plain English) —** When variation is data-driven, adding the next case is a safe, small change instead of surgery on tested code. The cost is an indirection layer that isn't worth it until variation actually exists (YAGNI — don't pre-build it).

Martin, *Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices* (Prentice Hall, 2002) ch. 9 — OCP; Wiggins et al., *The Twelve-Factor App* Factor III — Config (https://12factor.net/config).

## Clear contracts & interfaces

- **Good looks like —** Each module exposes a **small, intention-revealing public surface**; internals are not exported. Inputs/outputs/errors and invariants are explicit (types + the occasional doc/contract). Callers depend on the **interface**, not on internal structure. Breaking changes to a published contract are versioned (cross-ref `api-and-contracts`).
- **Auditor checks —** `[J]` Is the public API minimal, or does it leak internals (helpers, mutable state, concrete types where an interface belongs)? `[J]` Are error/edge outcomes part of the contract (typed errors / documented), not surprises? `[D]` Public-surface lint (`no internal export` / package `exports` map / API-extractor) where configured.
- **Confidence —** `mixed`
- **Tradeoff (plain English) —** A narrow, well-named interface lets you change the inside freely without breaking callers and tells the next engineer exactly how to use it. A leaky, sprawling surface ties your hands — every internal becomes something a caller might depend on.
- **Sources —** D. Parnas, "On the Criteria To Be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules," *CACM* 15(12) (1972) — information hiding; R.C. Martin, *Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices* (Prentice Hall, 2002) ch. 12 — Interface Segregation Principle; J. Bloch, *Effective Java* 3rd ed. (Addison-Wesley, 2018) Items 15 & 64 — "minimize accessibility", "design APIs deliberately".

## Low coupling / high cohesion

- **Good looks like —** Modules are **cohesive** (everything inside relates to one purpose) and **loosely coupled** (few, narrow, stable connections; no reaching into another module's internals; dependencies via interfaces/injection). No cyclic dependencies between modules. Changes stay local.
- **Auditor checks —** `[D]` **Cyclic dependencies** — `madge --circular` / dependency-cruiser / import-linter reports none. `[D]` Fan-in/fan-out & instability metrics where tooled (dependency-cruiser, SonarQube). `[J]` Does a module reach across a boundary into another's internals (high coupling) or own unrelated responsibilities (low cohesion)? `[J]` Is wiring done via injected interfaces rather than `new`-ing concretes inside business code?
- **Confidence —** `mixed`
- **Tradeoff (plain English) —** Loosely-coupled, cohesive modules can be understood, tested, and changed one at a time; tightly-coupled ones move as a tangled clump where touching one thing breaks three others. The cost is the discipline of boundaries and a little wiring.
- **Sources —** Stevens, Myers & Constantine, "Structured Design" (origin of coupling & cohesion); R.C. Martin (ADP — Acyclic Dependencies Principle; coupling/instability metrics, *Clean Architecture*); Parnas (information hiding).

## Knowledge-store shape (bound what a reader READS, not what the system KNOWS)

- **Good looks like —** Long-lived knowledge stores (ledgers, decision records, catalogs, registries) are shaped for **bounded per-consultation reads**: a lean index (locate, don't ingest) routes to small per-topic units, each under its own size cap; accretion grows **horizontally** (new units), never one monolith. Distinguish a **log** (entries supersede — condense periodically; a recorded cap-bump is a fine escape) from a **rule-book** (entries persist by design — a fixed total cap eventually collides with the store's floor; shard it instead). External references point at the index/entry point, never at unit internals, so a future unit split stays cheap.
- **Auditor checks —** `[D]` Per-unit size caps exist and are gate-checked where a budget gate is wired. `[J]` Is the store a log or a rule-book, and does its growth mechanism match (condense-and-cap vs index+shards)? `[J]` Do external references bypass the index into unit internals? `[J]` Does one consultation require ingesting the whole store?
- **Confidence —** `mixed`
- **Tradeoff (plain English) —** An index-plus-units store lets a reader pull only the topic they need instead of the whole archive; the cost is one routing hop and the discipline of filing entries in the right unit. Worked example: this harness's own decisions ledger — a 54 KB single-file rule-book at its condensed floor became an index + ten per-topic shards under per-shard caps (2026-07, plan 0040).
- **Sources —** Parnas (information hiding — the boundary as what the reader need not know); the architecture-tree "LOCATE, don't ingest" discipline this catalog's own repo records.

---

## Authoring rules (the catalog meta-rules — do not delete)

- **Additive floor:** add dimensions as you discover them; **never delete** one. This catalog is meant to become "every standard we can think of."
- **Right-size:** apply only *relevant* dimensions per change (`KISS`/`YAGNI`); never skip a relevant one. Relevance is a per-change judgment — see `README.md`.
- **Novel patterns allowed** when they add clear value — justify (problem → why existing patterns fall short → benefit) and record in `claugentic-DECISIONS.md`. Unconventional ≠ wrong.
- **Every dimension carries a Confidence tag** so the harness can separate what it *proved* (deterministic gates) from what it *asserts* (judgment). Trust the oracle, not the model's word.
