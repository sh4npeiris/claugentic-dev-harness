# Agent Development Workflow

> ### 👋 New here? Read this first
> This repo is built and maintained with an **agent-assisted workflow**:
> - **Small/local change?** Just make it — tests must pass, and the architecture-tree hook will prompt you to document any new source file in `docs/claugentic-ARCHITECTURE_TREE.md`.
> - **Substantial change?** (new subsystem, cross-cutting refactor, shared-contract change, or **~8+ files**) — don't free-code. The agent will **pause, ask questions, enter plan mode**, and run the pipeline below: a plan in `.claude/plans/`, an adversarial review, a spec **you approve**, implementation in an isolated branch, verification, then a retrospect that improves this harness.
> - **Your map of the codebase** is `docs/claugentic-ARCHITECTURE_TREE.md` (one line per file) — read it before diving into source. Specialist **roles** the agent delegates to live in `.claude/agents/` and grow over time.
> - **Decisions** → `docs/claugentic-DECISIONS.md`. **Backlog** → `docs/claugentic-ROADMAP.md`.
> - **Build mode** (`skills/build/SKILL.md`) is the orchestration layer that **auto-drives this pipeline over the audit backlog** — pick items or a whole tier and it works them through the stages below, pausing only at the decisions that are yours.

How agents **and** human devs take *substantial* work from idea → landed change while keeping quality high and the harness self-improving. CLAUDE.md links here; this is the source of truth for process.

> **One-line:** Triage → Discuss → Plan → Review the plan → Spec → **Approve** → Implement → Verify → Land → **Retrospect**. Small changes skip to Implement+Verify.

## 0. Triage — does this need the full pipeline?

**Full pipeline** for *substantial* work: a new subsystem, a cross-cutting refactor, a change to a shared contract/pattern/standard, a security boundary, or anything touching **roughly 8+ files** (or a pattern documented in CLAUDE.md / STANDARDS).

**Lightweight path** for small/local/mechanical changes: go straight to **Implement → Verify**, still updating `claugentic-ARCHITECTURE_TREE.md` and `claugentic-DECISIONS.md` as needed.

**Triage continuously, not just up front.** A conversation often *grows* into a substantial change. The moment a request is shaping up to cross the bar above (≈8 files, or any qualitative trigger), **stop free-coding**: ask the user clarifying questions — from technical *and* **product-discovery** angles (see Stage 1) — until scope is crystal-clear, then **enter plan mode (Stage 2)** and follow the pipeline — don't keep ad-hoc editing.

When unsure, default to full; the plan-reviewer (Stage 3) confirms the path was right.

---

## Principles (apply at every stage)

- **Slice small, land complete.** Every unit of work must be finishable by **one specialist agent in a single ≤1M-token-context session** and land **vertically complete** — no half-done state, no `TODO`/debt left behind. If it doesn't fit, decompose further *before* implementing. This is a hard gate, not a guideline.
- **No new tech debt.** A landed slice leaves the codebase at least as clean as it found it: tests added, docs/ARCHITECTURE_TREE updated, no dead code, no silenced errors.
- **The harness is living.** Any task may improve STANDARDS / CLAUDE.md / the `.claude/agents/` role library / this workflow. Stage 9 is how that happens; treat harness improvements as first-class output, not a chore.
- **Delegate liberally to preserve orchestrator context.** Use subagents freely and in parallel — **no resource constraints** — so the orchestrator's own context stays lean for synthesis and decisions (fan out reads, reviews, and implementation to specialists). The orchestrator picks whichever role(s) fit from the `.claude/agents/` library; as the library grows it has more specialists to choose from.
- **Effort-dial the machine.** Scale review/verification depth to the change's risk and size, and load only the standards modules the change *touches* (relevance-gating). The dial flips on the **same triggers Stage 0 uses to call work *substantial*** — a **security/trust boundary · a shared contract/pattern/standard · ~8+ files · or any trust/honesty surface** (per the diverse-critics principle below): a small/local change gets a quick **solo `architect-reviewer`** look; any of those triggers fans out the lenses (and, on a trust surface, the diverse panel — that principle names *who* joins; this names *when* to fan out). Don't run the whole machine on a trivial change — that's how a harness kills the velocity it's meant to protect.
- **Diverse critics on contested or trust-surface changes.** A contested design fork OR a trust/honesty surface (claims, `[D]`/`[J]` labels, proof-vs-attempt wording, a security boundary) triggers the **diverse panel** — `plan-reviewer`/`architect-reviewer` + `yagni-sentinel` + `honesty-reviewer`, **plus `product-designer` when the change is user-facing** (so the review confirms the plan still achieves what the user is trying to achieve, not just that it's technically sound) — at **every gate that change passes** (Plan **and** Verify); else a lone reviewer suffices. At **Verify**, the wired mechanism is `engine/verify.js`: the orchestrator **invokes** it (the invocation is model-upheld — the platform does not auto-fire workflows), and the script then convenes the panel mechanically; if the Workflow tool is unavailable, say so, convene the panel in prose, and tag the run **"prose-orchestrated"** — never claim script guarantees on a prose run. At **Plan**, the panel is the **advisory Stage-2b deep-dive** (*The pipeline* → *Stage 2, the draft → advisory-panel → incorporate sub-process*) — a **standard** step for substantial work (not contested-only), **prose-convened** (no engine path; the `lens-reviewer` *plan-design-review* engine mode is deferred to `0026` §C), and **builder-class: it CONTRIBUTES, it does not gate** (Stage 3 is the gate).
- **Review is cross-review by separate specialist agents — each on the most capable available model, each clean-context.** The gate/refute roles — `plan-reviewer` · `architect-reviewer` · `honesty-reviewer` · `finding-verifier` — are **distinct specialist agents** (separate roles, separate contexts); each works only from `{claim, file:line, …}` and **never sees the builder's rationale or transcript**, so it cannot rubber-stamp the reasoning. The independence is of **context and role** — a separate agent, a clean contract, a single lens — **not** of model: every agent runs the most capable available model, so blind spots can still correlate, and the harness says so (it does **not** claim model-independent review). **Honest claim:** multiple skeptical, clean-context specialist passes on the most capable model — a reduction of rubber-stamping risk, never a guarantee. *(The engine keeps a `RUNNING AS` / `sameModelTag` note as an honest per-run model-relationship reporter; it no longer engineers cross-model de-correlation.)*
- **Model tiers — by capability, never a pinned version.** The harness picks models by capability *tier* via aliases that auto-resolve to the current model in that tier: **most capable** (`opus`) · **mid / cheaper** (`sonnet`) · **fastest / cheapest** (`haiku`). Default to the **most capable available model** for anything needing judgment — *including high-volume review*; drop to a cheaper tier only for genuinely mechanical work. **Accuracy first, usage-conservation second.** The tier→alias mapping is the single thing to change if a tier is ever renamed (the engine `MODELS` block + the agents' `model:` frontmatter).
- Plus the CLAUDE.md non-negotiables: SOLID > DRY > KISS > YAGNI · fail loudly · validate at boundaries · configurable-over-hardcoded · single source of truth.

---

## Context & handoff

- **The durable memory is the plan file + `claugentic-DECISIONS.md` + `claugentic-ARCHITECTURE_TREE.md`** — keep them current as you go. For long work, a **fresh session resuming from the plan checklist beats a deeply-compacted context**; no manual orchestrator "handover" is needed.
- **Delegate token-heavy work to subagents** to keep the orchestrator lean (the *Delegate liberally* principle above — this is its context payoff).

---

## Roles — a library, not a fixed pair

The orchestrator **selects the role(s) that fit the task** and may spawn several or compose them. It is not locked to a fixed sequence of agents.

Starter library (`.claude/agents/`):
- **`plan-reviewer`** — adversarially critiques a plan (correctness, SOLID/patterns, risk, **sizing & completeness**, over-engineering/YAGNI, harness impact); writes findings into the plan file.
- **`implementer-architect`** — implements an approved spec to standard, in an isolated worktree, landing one slice complete.
- **`product-designer`** — the product/UX lens at Discuss (Stage 1) for user-facing work: user, job-to-be-done, flows, states, "what good feels like"; applies `docs/claugentic-standards/product-ux.md`, persists to `docs/claugentic-PRODUCT.md`.
- **`product-critic`** — critiques a draft product spec by method and returns proposals the user decides on; the elevate counterpart to `product-designer` (builder-class, read-only).
- **`architect-reviewer`** — owns the Verify gate (Stage 7): **solo** for small changes, or **synthesizer** over fan-out findings for risky ones.
- **`lens-reviewer`** — audits a **diff (Verify) or an audit-scope (the `audit` skill)** against **one** `docs/claugentic-standards/` module; invoked once per relevant lens in a fan-out review.
- **`finding-verifier`** — refutes **one** audit finding against the code: given only the claim + `file:line` (never the finder's rationale), it tries to prove the finding wrong and returns `Verified` / `Refuted` / `Unconfirmed`. The audit's adversarial-verify counterpart to `lens-reviewer`.
- **`blindspot-reviewer`** — the audit's cross-cutting / between-the-modules sweep (the `thorough` dial's diverse blind-spot finder): its lens is the *whole scope*, red-teaming for the risk **no single module-lens owns** (emergent architectural smells, integration gaps, systemic cross-cutting issues). Returns the same finding shape as `lens-reviewer`, so it joins the same dedup → prune → verify path; always `exhaustive` depth.
- **`yagni-sentinel`** — the anti-over-engineering skeptic; argues a plan/diff is *too much*. The deliberate counterweight to the quality lenses. (Also the audit's `thorough`-only adversarial prune over consolidated findings.)
- **`honesty-reviewer`** — the claims / over-claim lens; refutes **copy** (not code), flagging text that launders model-or-human-upheld judgment into apparent mechanical fact (the verb discipline · `[D]`/`[J]` label integrity · dimension-scoped success claims). Part of the diverse panel at Plan + Verify on trust/honesty surfaces.

Also available without new files: built-in **`Explore`** (fan-out search), **`Plan`** (drafting), and `/code-review` · `/simplify` for diff cleanup. **Add new role files as needs emerge** — the library grows (Stage 9).

## The pipeline

**The ten stages group into four beats — `FRAME → APPROVE → BUILD → CLOSE`** (a one-glance map; no stage is cut or renumbered):

- **FRAME** (0 Triage · 1 Discuss · 2 Plan · 3 Review · 4 Spec) — converge on *what to build and how*.
- **APPROVE** (5) — the user's sign-off; *no code before this*.
- **BUILD** (6 Implement · 7 Verify) — build it and check it.
- **CLOSE** (8 Land · 9 Retrospect) — ship it, harvest the lessons.

| # | Stage | Beat | Owner | Output |
|---|-------|------|-------|--------|
| 0 | **Triage** | FRAME | orchestrator | full vs lightweight path |
| 1 | **Discuss & brainstorm** | FRAME | orchestrator + **user** | learn the endeavour from multiple **angles** before planning — technical scope **+ product-discovery** (who's the user · the job-to-be-done · what success/"delight" looks like · the key flows & their states); these surface the user-story gaps a technical-only intake misses. User-facing work pulls in `product-designer` → `docs/claugentic-PRODUCT.md`. Crystal-clear scope; tangents→ROADMAP, decisions→DECISIONS |
| 2 | **Draft plan** | FRAME | orchestrator / `Plan` (+ advisory panel) | `.claude/plans/NNNN-<slug>.md` (Problem · Approach · **Architecture & holistic fit** · Risks · Test strategy · slices — Review & Spec filled later), **sliced into ≤1-session units**. For *substantial* work the draft **MUST** fill the **Architecture & holistic fit** section (the forcing function — see below) and run the **2a draft → 2b advisory deep-dive → 2c incorporate** sub-process (see below); trivial/lightweight changes keep the lightweight path (2a → Stage 3, no panel) and may give the section a one-liner or skip it |
| 3 | **Review the plan** | FRAME | `plan-reviewer` (+ others as fit) | critique written into the plan's *Review* section; iterate until it passes the gate |
| 4 | **Spec** | FRAME | orchestrator | plan upgraded to implementation-ready spec **per slice**: opens with a short plain-English block (*what this builds · what "done" means for you · what you're accepting — risks/trade-offs*), then file-by-file changes, signatures, test list, acceptance criteria, **+ the in-scope `docs/claugentic-standards/` dimensions & target bar (entry point: `docs/claugentic-ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md`)** |
| 5 | **Approval gate** | APPROVE | **user** | sign-off on the spec — *no code before this* |
| 6 | **Implement** | BUILD | `implementer-architect` | one slice/session, isolated worktree/branch; upholds CLAUDE.md; updates ARCHITECTURE_TREE inline |
| 7 | **Verify** | BUILD | `architect-reviewer` (+ lenses) | **effort-dialed** on the same triggers that flip Stage-0 to *substantial* — a security/trust boundary · a shared contract/pattern/standard · ~8+ files · any trust/honesty surface (per the diverse-panel principle): a **small/local** change → `architect-reviewer` audits solo; any of those triggers → fan out the panel via **`engine/verify.js`** (the orchestrator invokes it — `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/engine/verify.js` for an adopter, the repo-local `./engine/verify.js` dogfooding this repo; spike-verified read-from-install-path) — one `lens-reviewer` per relevant `docs/claugentic-standards/` module **+** `yagni-sentinel` (**+ `honesty-reviewer`** on a trust surface), then `architect-reviewer` **synthesizes**, with the judge `model:` (the most-capable tier) and same-model tag computed in code. Workflow tool unavailable → convene in prose and tag the run **"prose-orchestrated."** **All Definition-of-Done gates green** (see below); run **`/simplify`** + **`/code-review`**; confirm spec match. Findings are **dual-layer** (technical + plain-English). |
| 8 | **Land** | CLOSE | orchestrator | conventional commit/PR; remove the completed plan from `.claude/plans/` (git history keeps it); append DECISIONS |
| 9 | **Retrospect & evolve** | CLOSE | orchestrator | harvest learnings into the harness (see below) |

**Stage 3 gate — a plan may not pass review until:** it is correct & sound (SOLID/patterns), each slice is **session-sized and lands complete with no debt**, the right path was chosen, risks + test strategy are stated, the **Architecture & holistic fit** section is genuinely reasoned (for substantial work — see below), and any harness impact (new STANDARD/agent/doc) is noted. The reviewer writes a verdict + required changes into the plan; the orchestrator iterates.

**Stage 2, the architect-pass mandate (architecture framed from the start):** because architecture is **model-upheld** (agents sometimes skip it), the plan `TEMPLATE.md` carries a required **Architecture & holistic fit** section the Stage-2 draft **must fill for substantial work** — initial architect thoughts on codebase fit (layering · module placement · design patterns · SOLID/SoC) · product fit · the **quality dimensions to uphold, each mapped to its `docs/claugentic-standards/` module** (so the standards frame the plan, not discovered late — this is the forward-pointer the Stage-4 Spec's *in-scope dimensions* refines per slice) · future-proofing. These are **initial framing, NOT the deep per-slice Spec** (that stays JIT in build), and they GUIDE every downstream agent. **Scoped to substantial work** — trivial/lightweight changes keep the lightweight path and may give the section a one-liner or skip it (honor the effort-dial; no holistic pass on a typo fix). **Enforcement = structural prompt + review, NOT a mechanical gate:** the template forces the section to *exist*; `plan-reviewer` audits it is genuinely reasoned (not hand-waved, not gold-plated — `yagni-sentinel` guards the over-build edge). You can't mechanically grade architecture; you can require the section and review it. Plans are ephemeral (deleted at Land), so a richer plan is working scaffolding, never always-loaded context-bloat.

**Stage 2, the draft → advisory-panel → incorporate sub-process (for *substantial* work):** Stage 2 is itself three steps — **2a draft · 2b specialist advisory deep-dive · 2c incorporate** — so the diverse-panel-at-Plan (named in *Diverse critics* above) is a **standard** Stage-2 step for substantial work, not an ad-hoc afterthought. **Stage 3 (Review) stays the gate, unchanged.** The three steps:

- **2a — Draft.** The orchestrator drafts in **plan mode** (the built-in `Plan` capability) → a plan file **structured by `TEMPLATE.md`**, with the **Architecture & holistic fit** section filled (the architect-pass = the forcing function above). This is the planner's first pass.
- **2b — Specialist advisory deep-dive (ADVISORY, builder-class — contributes, does NOT gate).** A **scoped panel** reviews the draft's **design** and returns advisory feedback: the **in-scope `docs/claugentic-standards/` lenses** (relevance-gated — only the dimensions the change touches) **+** the cross-cutting critics `yagni-sentinel` (is this too much?) and `honesty-reviewer` (do the plan's claims over-state?) **+ `product-designer` when the change is user-facing** (does the design still achieve what the user is trying to do?). This is **prose-convened** — the orchestrator spawns the panel directly; there is **no engine path** for it (the `engine/verify.js` `lens-reviewer` *plan-design-review* MODE is **deferred to `0026` §C** — do NOT wire it here; §C authors that mode once, against the final agent roster, to avoid a double-touch of `verify.js` + the spawn-id pins). The panel **CONTRIBUTES, it does not gate** — its feedback is input to 2c, not a pass/fail verdict.
- **2c — Incorporate.** The planner folds the panel's feedback into a **refined plan**. The **2b↔2c loop is bounded — 1 round by default**: advisory feedback has no natural stop, so the planner decides whether a second round genuinely adds value (diminishing returns) rather than looping for polish. The refined plan then goes to **Stage 3 Review** (`plan-reviewer`, the adversarial **gate**) → Stage 5 Approve.

**Same panel, two altitudes (HONEST framing):** most of these lenses appear again at **Stage 7 Verify** — but there they review **code** and **GATE** (a `CHANGES_REQUIRED` blocks the land), whereas at **2b** they review **design** and only **CONTRIBUTE** (advisory input the planner weighs). 2b is **model-upheld, builder-class** — convening it and weighing its feedback are judgment calls; it does **not** mechanically improve the plan, and Stage 3 remains the only Stage-2/3 gate. **Scoped to substantial work ONLY:** 2b fires on the **same Stage-0 substantial triggers** that gate the diverse panel and the architect-pass — a **security/trust boundary · a shared contract/pattern/standard · ~8+ files · any trust/honesty surface**. **A trivial/lightweight plan stays 2a → Stage 3 with NO advisory panel** (honor the effort-dial — the panel does **not** run on every plan; running the whole machine on a small change is the velocity-killer the *Effort-dial* principle warns against).

**Stage 4 → 5, the plain-English layer (the non-engineer's steering wheel):** the spec contract is code-shaped (file-by-file edits, signatures, named dimensions), but approval is about *intent, not code*. So every spec **MUST open with a short plain-English block — *what this builds · what "done" means for you · what you're accepting (risks/trade-offs)*** — and that block is **presented first at the approval gate (Stage 5)**, with the file-by-file detail beneath it. The user approves the intent; the detail is there to verify against, not to decode. *(The plan `TEMPLATE.md` carries a matching section.)*

**Stage 1, the plain-English open (say why before the questions):** when Discuss begins, tell the user in plain English why you're asking before any code — *"Before any code I'll ask a few questions about who this is for and what 'good' looks like; your answers steer everything downstream."* Then ask. (The *why* of Discuss is the Stage-1 row above — this is just the user-facing opener, not a second rationale.)

**Keep the docs current — it's part of each stage (no hooks needed beyond the tree check):**
- **Implement (6):** update `claugentic-ARCHITECTURE_TREE.md` for any file add/move/remove (also hook-nudged); touch `CLAUDE.md` only for a genuinely new gotcha/command/pattern — *concisely; index, don't duplicate code*.
- **Verify (7) — honesty register:** the report says what the verify **attempted and tagged**, never what it "proved." Deterministic gates passed; reviewer sign-offs are model-upheld judgment, not a guarantee.
- **Land (8):** append a dated one-liner to `claugentic-DECISIONS.md` for non-trivial choices; update `ROADMAP.md` if scope shifted; **run the Stage-9 harvest checklist** (below) before moving on.
- **Land (8) — honesty register:** the close-out names **which gate-class passed** — the *deterministic gates* (tests, tree-check, lint/type/security) vs the *reviewer sign-offs* (the audited dimensions) — never a blanket "verified/done."
- **Land (8) — close out for the user:** after the slice lands, say it plainly — *"This one's done. Next: pick another item the same way, run `/claugentic-dev-harness:build` to keep working the backlog, or re-run `/claugentic-dev-harness:audit` for a fresh picture — you're finished when Tier 1 and Tier 2 come back empty."*
- **Retrospect (9):** promote durable learnings into the `docs/claugentic-standards/` modules (entry point: `docs/claugentic-ENGINEERING_STANDARDS.md`) / `CLAUDE.md` / agent files.

> ### Adopter note — reading this doc inside YOUR repo (not the harness)
> When the `claugentic-dev-harness` plugin is installed into your project, this WORKFLOW.md is a **managed copy** living in your `docs/`. So a few references below resolve to the **installed plugin**, not to files your repo must contain:
> - **The specialist agents** (`plan-reviewer`, `architect-reviewer`, `lens-reviewer`, `yagni-sentinel`, `honesty-reviewer`, …) **and the `engine/*.js` scripts** referenced throughout live **inside the installed plugin** — agents are resolved at spawn (by their namespaced id), engine scripts are run via the Workflow tool from the install path. They are **NOT** a `.claude/agents/` or `engine/` directory your repo has to provide.
> - **The Definition of Done's *deterministic gates* mean THIS project's OWN gates** — *your* lint, *your* type-check, and *your* test suite — plus the architecture-tree check. The specific commands written below (`python -m pytest`, `python scripts/check_versions_synced.py`) are the **harness's own self-test** for developing the plugin itself (version-sync checks the *plugin's* two manifests and is irrelevant to an adopter). **Substitute your project's equivalents.**
> - **The architecture-tree check is wired as a hook by `init` only when the tree-gate is enabled** — a fresh or mature-no-tree repo gets a harness-format tree and the hook; a mature repo that already has its own tree is **asked** (replace it with a harness skeleton → gate on, or keep yours → **gate off, no hook wired**). If you keep your own tree (gate off), there's no hook — run `scripts/claugentic-check_architecture_tree.py` (with `python` / `python3` / `py`) manually at Verify if you ever want a one-off check.

## Definition of Done

A slice is **done** — and may land (Stage 8) — only when **all** hold. Two groups, same bar; they differ in *who* says pass:

**Deterministic gates** (pass/fail, can't be argued around):
1. **Full test suite green** + any regression/snapshot tests — *your* project's suite. *(This plugin's own suite is `python -m pytest`.)*
2. **Architecture-tree check green** (when the gate is wired) — file-index presence, staleness, and **glob-drift detection**. Run it with whichever interpreter you have (`python` / `python3` / `py`): `scripts/claugentic-check_architecture_tree.py`.
   - **Updating the codebase map (the handled drift case).** When this gate reports *glob drift* — it's watching no files while the repo now contains source (e.g. an `init`'d empty repo that has since grown real code) — surface it to the user in plain English: *"I'm updating your codebase map to match your new code"* — then re-detect the layout and reset `INCLUDE_GLOBS` (init step 5's terminating self-correction). **Scope the claim honestly:** this is the *handled* drift path reading as plain English — a **genuine gate crash still fails loud by design** (CLAUDE.md: never swallow errors); don't promise "no error ever," only that this one case is plain.
3. **Version-sync green** — *harness-self only* (developing this plugin): `python scripts/check_versions_synced.py` enforces `plugin.json` ↔ `marketplace.json` version equality (`plugin.json` is the source of truth). A **run-gate** (like `pytest`), not hook-wired; scope is the two manifest versions only. **Not applicable to adopter repos** — skip it.
4. **Doc-budget green** — the managed ledgers (`CLAUDE.md`, `claugentic-DECISIONS.md`, `claugentic-ROADMAP.md`) stay within byte budget: `python scripts/check_doc_budgets.py`. A **run-gate** (like version-sync), not hook-wired; it emits a **WARN at ≥90%** (the cue to condense — merge superseded entries to git history) and fails only on a strict breach.
   - **Condense on WARN (model-upheld, the ledger-condensation discipline).** A ≥90% WARN is a **do-it-now signal, not a deferral** — as part of the current work, **condense that ledger**: merge superseded/settled/landed entries into git history (the archive) and keep only the still-true, forward-looking essentials a future agent actually needs. The always-/often-loaded context stays lean by design; a ledger that only grows is tech debt. No separate task — the WARN is the cue, the condense is the work.
5. **The project's lint / type-check / security gates** green.

**Reviewer sign-offs** (model judgment, not a mechanical gate):
5. **In-scope `docs/claugentic-standards/` dimensions pass** the `architect-reviewer` audit (incl. SOLID) — solo, or synthesized from `lens-reviewer`s + `yagni-sentinel` — for what this slice touches; `/simplify` + `/code-review` run.
6. **Runtime QA (dial-gated)** — when the slice's spec carries acceptance criteria (the `docs/claugentic-PRODUCT_SPEC.md` schema) and the repo records a run-the-app command, and the Verify dial has fanned out: the QA workflow (`engine/qa.js`) attempts each criterion's flow in the running app and tags the outcome (screenshots on failure); findings join the Verify synthesis. The script mechanically sequences the flow attempts and never silently skips (a QA run that could not boot the app reports exactly that); invoking it, and the flow observations themselves, are model-upheld.

**Plus:** acceptance criteria met (the spec's checklist) **+ no new tech debt.**

## Decision-gated autonomy (when to stop, when to proceed)

While iterating to the bar above, the agent **proceeds autonomously by default** and **stops only for a decision that is genuinely the user's.** This replaces the old binary *checkpoint (three routine pauses) vs build-to-green* ladder: the question is never "which rung am I on," it is **"is this a real choice the user must make?"** — judged per moment against four crisp rules. (The separate *who-watches-the-run* axis — an unwatched, engine-driven run earned per-repo — survives as **build-to-green**, below; it changes *who is watching*, not *when to stop*.)

**This is MODEL-UPHELD, not a mechanical gate.** The agent *judges* "is this a real choice?" against the criteria + examples below — nothing mechanically forces a stop at the right moment. The cost of a mis-judgment is **bounded by flag-and-surface** (a wrong "proceed" on a **reversible** call becomes a flagged item the user sees at the close — not a silent action), **except** for the irreversible class (c): a wrong "proceed" there is *not* recoverable by later review, so class (c) is a hard stop the flag path can never absorb. The bar is the criteria, not a guarantee.

- **STOP (blocking) — ONLY for a must-decide.** Three classes, and only these:
  - **(a) a genuine design fork** — multiple valid options with no clearly-right answer (a preference/architecture call that's the user's to make). *e.g. "store the worklist in a state file or derive it from the backlog?" — both work; ask.*
  - **(b) a spec with a real trade-off to accept** — the change buys X at the cost of Y and the user must accept the trade. *e.g. "the simplest fix drops support for the legacy format — accept that?"*
  - **(c) an irreversible / outward action** — commit-to-shared (push to a shared remote / `main`), republish/deploy, delete user content, spend, any external side-effect. **This is a HARD stop the FLAG path can NEVER absorb — even on a low-confidence call** (a wrong proceed here can't be undone by async review; the flag safety net covers only reversible judgments). *e.g. "push this to main?" — always ask.*
- **RESEARCH, don't ask — for a FACTUAL / technical uncertainty.** A question the agent can resolve from official / trusted sources is settled by **research (cited)**, never a user stop. Stops are for the user's *preference / judgment*, not for facts the agent can look up. *e.g. "does this API accept a null body?" — read the official docs and cite, don't ask the user.*
- **FLAG (non-blocking) — for a REVERSIBLE judgment.** A should-know (a judgment call · an accepted risk · a deviation from the spec · a low-confidence choice) whose cost-if-wrong is **reversible**: record a **one-line flag + the chosen default** and **CONTINUE** — async-reviewable, never a mid-run stop. *e.g. "named the helper `selectItems` (spec didn't say); FLAG + continued."* (A low-confidence *irreversible* call is **not** a flag — it is class (c) → STOP.)
- **SURFACE all flags at the close.** The close-out lists every flag raised during the run as **"things to review,"** so the user reviews them async *after* the work lands — not interrupted mid-run. (The running list lives in the plan file's Status block as a `Flags:` sub-line — kept **distinct** from the plan's disposition field; the close-out surfaces flags **and** dispositions as two separate concerns.)

**Acceptance:** an autonomous run completes without stopping for anything that isn't a genuine user-action; every reversible judgment is flagged with a chosen default and surfaced at the close; a factual uncertainty triggers cited research, not a stop; the three blocking-stop classes always stop.

**build-to-green (the who-watches axis — earned per-repo).** Running **unwatched** (engine-driven: `engine/build-item.js` runs the implement → gates → verify → fix loop mechanically, returning only at the retained hard stops) is **requestable**, unlocked per-repo only when CI runs the deterministic gates, a test baseline covers the touched code, and the item traces to an approved spec with testable acceptance criteria — the contract, the evidence-stated checks, and the verbatim decline live in `skills/build/SKILL.md` → Mode handling; the engine is built and runs only via the Workflow tool from the installed plugin (the session precondition), so a build-to-green ask declines only when a per-repo condition is unmet or that engine is unavailable. Watched or unwatched, the **decision-gated rules above govern when to stop** (the class-(c) irreversible hard stop is a *return* to the orchestrator in the engine case); build-to-green is a reduction of unwatched-run risk, never a substitute for the unbuilt deterministic trust-gates.

Iterate to meet this **fixed** bar, then **stop** — it terminates because the bar is *finite*, not "is it perfect?". Genuinely separate future work → `ROADMAP.md` (backlog, *not* debt).

## Executing an audit backlog item — tag → discipline

`/claugentic-dev-harness:audit` writes a tagged backlog into `docs/claugentic-ROADMAP.md`; there is **no separate refactor command**. Each item runs through the pipeline above, and its **tag selects the discipline** the implementer applies. The tag→discipline mapping is defined here (the canonical home); the rationale is settled — don't re-litigate it.

| Tag | Discipline |
|-----|-----------|
| **`refactor`** | **Characterization-tests-first — a HARD precondition.** A refactor item on untested behavior-bearing code **cannot start until its Tier-1 "establish a test baseline" item is done**; if that baseline is absent, the implementer **stops and asks** rather than touching code. Durable enforcement will be the Trust-track `PreToolUse` characterization hook (the first Phase-1 item); **until that hook lands, this is upheld by the implementer + the Verify gate** — not yet automatic. **Say this to the user when the pause fires:** *"Before I tidy this code I need to capture what it currently does as a test, or I can't prove I didn't change its behavior — so I'll establish that baseline first."* |
| **`capability-upgrade`** | Migration safety — feature-flag the new path · dual-write / shadow-read · keep a rollback. |
| **`dependency-health`** | Update + verify — bump, run the full suite green, check the changelog for breaking changes. |
| **`bug`** | Reproduce-first — a **failing test that captures the bug**, then the fix that makes it pass. |
| **`feature`** | The standard pipeline (no extra precondition). |

## 9. The learning loop (how the harness grows)

A **finite harvest checklist the orchestrator RUNS at Land** (manual discipline, not automation — the orchestrator runs it; it does not trigger by itself). Sweep these six; for each, **emit the edit** or an explicit *"nothing durable this slice"*:

- **(a)** A convention that recurred across review findings → **promote to STANDARDS / CLAUDE.md**. A promoted lesson **must record the incident that motivated it** (the failure/near-miss it prevents) — so the rule is un-cargo-cultable and safe to delete once its cause is gone.
- **(b)** A manual/lens catch that a gate or checklist **could have made** → **open a gate item on `ROADMAP.md`** (not just a `claugentic-DECISIONS.md` line — a logged decision doesn't become a check by itself). *(Worked example: a manual catch that recurred at Verify — logged as a decision but never enforced — gets opened as a `ROADMAP.md` gate item so it becomes a real check, not just a note.)*
- **(c)** A prompt tweak that sharpened a specialist → **fold into the `.claude/agents/` role file**.
- **(d)** Process friction → **edit this `WORKFLOW.md`**.
- **(e)** Every non-trivial choice → **one dated line in `claugentic-DECISIONS.md`**.
- **(f)** A **load-bearing invariant** this slice established or relied on (a "must stay true or X breaks" constraint whose rationale isn't obvious from the code) → **record it in `docs/claugentic-INVARIANTS.md`** with its why + dated provenance. **Create the file lazily** — only when you have the first genuine invariant to record (do not seed it empty); most slices have none, so the honest emit is usually *"no new invariant this slice."*

**Promotion is two-tier (manual, user-approved):** a *universal* lesson → stage in `docs/claugentic-standards/CANDIDATES.md`, then promote upstream so every repo gets it on update; a *codebase-specific* lesson stays **local** (`CLAUDE.md` / `claugentic-DECISIONS.md`), never propagated.

## Plan file lifecycle

`​.claude/plans/NNNN-<slug>.md` (active, contains Plan + Review + Spec + slice checklist) — one plan per substantial change; the slices inside it are the per-session units. Numbering is sequential (`0001`, `0002`, …).

**A plan completes — and is removed (git history keeps it) — once every remaining item has a disposition, gated *only* on the committed slice, never on deferred/rejected/blocked parts.** At close (or on demand), give each still-unchecked item one of three dispositions:

- **done** — checked off (it landed).
- **defer** — a one-line item on `docs/claugentic-ROADMAP.md`; OR, for a substantial / externally-blocked remainder, **move the remaining items into a NEW plan file** (+ one roadmap line pointing to it). Either way the *current* plan closes now.
- **reject** — recorded as a declined decision (a `docs/claugentic-DECISIONS.md` line so it isn't re-proposed) and dropped.

Then the plan **completes and is deleted.** A plan **never lingers `pending` waiting on an outside event** — when the last pieces are blocked externally, defer-to-new-plan (or reject) and **close now**. (`skills/build/SKILL.md` close-out + `.claude/plans/TEMPLATE.md`'s Disposition note carry the same model.)

### Scope that emerges mid-build — the in-flight split

Work surfacing *while building* is **not** silently absorbed; it splits two ways (the user makes the call at plan-review / approve, or at disposition; the architect-pass frames what is genuinely in-scope):

- **(a) intrinsic to the feature** (genuinely part of *this* plan's requirement) → **fold it into the plan**: account · spec · deliver, and **re-run the steps** (plan → review → spec → build → verify). The decomposition grows because it *is* the feature — that is agile in-scope discovery, not creep.
- **(b) out-of-scope** (a defect, or unrelated work) → does **not** bloat the plan. Record it on `docs/claugentic-ROADMAP.md` (a defect → the **Bugs** section; other work → the relevant backlog) and carry on.

**There is no "tech-debt" parking section — debt is structurally prevented, not parked.** Every slice lands complete (the Definition of Done, no shortcuts) and Verify audits the diff against the in-scope standards *before* it lands — so work that would otherwise become debt is built wholly instead: in-scope discovery → fold and re-run; a too-big slice → re-decompose into complete slices; an emergent design flaw → re-plan + re-review; genuinely out-of-scope work → its own roadmap item + its own complete plan (built wholly later); an external blocker → deferred + tracked. *Deferring scope* (tracked, completed wholly later) is not *creating debt* (a half-done thing left in code — not allowed). This is **model-upheld and reviewer-caught, not a mechanical guarantee** — the process prevents debt structurally; it does not make debt impossible by machine. *Existing* debt in an adopter codebase is the **audit's** domain (Quality findings, tracked-to-fix).
